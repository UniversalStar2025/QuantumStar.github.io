      <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
      <p>Last updated: <span id="tdate"></span></p>

      <p>These Terms of Use (the “Terms”, “EULA”) govern your use of the mobile games, websites, and related services provided by Quantum Star Games (“Quantum Star”, “we”, “our”, “us”). By installing, accessing, or using any of our Services, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Services.</p>

      <h2>1) Eligibility & Accounts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You must be at least 13 years old to use the Services. If you are 13–17, your legal guardian must review and agree to these Terms and supervise your use.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activity under your account.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2) License</h2>
      <p>Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, we grant you a personal, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to download, access, and use the Services for your own non-commercial entertainment. We reserve all rights not expressly granted.</p>

      <h2>3) Prohibited Conduct</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not cheat, exploit bugs, use bots, hacks, or unauthorized third-party software.</li>
        <li>Do not interfere with servers or networks, harass other users, or post illegal, infringing, or offensive content.</li>
        <li>Do not attempt to reverse engineer or extract source code except where such restriction is prohibited by applicable law.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4) In-App Purchases & Subscriptions</h2>
      <p>Our games may offer one-time purchases and <strong>auto-renewable subscriptions</strong>. Purchases are processed by the platform provider (e.g., Apple App Store or Google Play). Platform terms, including billing and refunds, apply.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Title & Length.</strong> Each subscription clearly states its name and duration (e.g., “Monthly Pass — 1 month”).</li>
        <li><strong>Price.</strong> The price (and, where appropriate, price per unit period) is shown in-app and may vary by region and taxes.</li>
        <li><strong>Auto-renewal.</strong> Subscriptions renew automatically unless you turn off auto-renew at least 24 hours before the current period ends.</li>
        <li><strong>Charges.</strong> Your account is charged at confirmation of purchase and for renewal within 24 hours before the period ends.</li>
        <li><strong>Manage / Cancel.</strong> You can manage or cancel subscriptions in your platform account settings (e.g., App Store or Google Play). Deleting the app does not cancel a subscription.</li>
        <li><strong>Trials.</strong> If a free trial is offered, any unused portion is forfeited when you purchase a subscription for the same product.</li>
        <li><strong>Changes.</strong> If prices or terms change, we or the platform will notify you as required by local law or platform policy. Continued use after the change takes effect constitutes acceptance.</li>
        <li><strong>Virtual Items.</strong> Virtual currency or items have no real-world monetary value, are licensed, not sold, and may be modified or discontinued at any time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>See also our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> regarding how purchase and subscription data are processed.</p>

      <h2>5) User Content & Community Rules</h2>
      <p>If the Services allow you to post or share content (“User Content”), you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable license to host, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, and display such content for operating and improving the Services (including moderation, safety, and promotion). You represent that you have all necessary rights to grant this license and that your content complies with law and these Terms. We may remove content or suspend accounts at our discretion to maintain a safe environment.</p>

      <h2>6) Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>The Services, including software, artwork, characters, audio, and other content, are owned by or licensed to Quantum Star and are protected by law. Trademarks, logos, and trade dress may not be used without our prior written permission.</p>

      <h2>7) Third-Party Services & Ads</h2>
      <p>The Services may include third-party SDKs, analytics, or advertising. Your use of those features may be subject to third-party terms. We are not responsible for third-party websites or services. For details on data sharing and choices (including ad-related preferences), see our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

      <h2>8) Termination</h2>
      <p>We may suspend or terminate your access (and any licenses granted) at any time if you breach these Terms, create legal risk, or misuse the Services. You may stop using the Services at any time. Some provisions (e.g., intellectual property, disclaimers, limitation of liability, dispute terms) survive termination.</p>

      <h2>9) Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not warrant that the Services will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.</p>

      <h2>10) Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, QUANTUM STAR AND ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND PARTNERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, OR GOODWILL. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO US FOR THE SERVICE IN THE SIX (6) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. Nothing in these Terms limits liability that cannot be limited under applicable law.</p>

      <h2>11) Indemnity</h2>
      <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Quantum Star harmless from claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of your breach of these Terms or misuse of the Services.</p>

      <h2>12) Governing Law & Disputes</h2>
      <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Singapore, without regard to conflict-of-laws principles. You and Quantum Star submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Singapore for disputes arising out of or relating to the Terms or Services, except where local consumer law gives you the right to bring claims in your home jurisdiction. Mandatory consumer rights in your country of residence are not affected.</p>

      <h2>13) Platform Terms & Third-Party Beneficiaries</h2>
      <p>When you obtain the app from Apple or Google, your use is also subject to the platform’s terms. Apple Inc. and Google LLC (and their subsidiaries) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms and may enforce them against you.</p>

      <h2>14) Changes</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms to reflect operational, legal, or regulatory changes. We will update the “Last updated” date above and, where required, provide additional notice. Continued use after changes take effect signifies acceptance.</p>
